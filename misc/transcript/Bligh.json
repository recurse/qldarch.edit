At the end of a financial year Neil Britton would have a project ready to go, when at the end of the financial year, when all this money hadn’t been spent, the power that be from government would say, here I’ve got $5 million or $10 million, what’s a building that I can do, and Neil Britton would say, “I’ve got one here.” And we had working drawings ready to go.  But, that was a thing where I actually ended up sitting on the Building and Grounds Committee and there was very clear briefing, you know, we were able to do between them and us with Neil Britton, who was a hands on sort of fellow, if we were doing the Animal Industry Building, then we got to talk to the people who were teaching and running animal industries and what it had to do and we did things largely on budget and on time.
