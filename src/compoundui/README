This tool requires access to a SPARQL Repository. I would suggest the Apache Jena's Fuseki. 

It is available for zip download here.
[https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/jena/jena-fuseki/1.0.1-SNAPSHOT/jena-fuseki-1.0.1-20130914.081056-2-distribution.zip]
Documentation can be found here.
[http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/#getting-started-with-fuseki]

The variables baseUrl, repositoryBaseURL, repositoryGraphStoreEndPoint and repositoryGraphNamePrefix 
in contants.js may need to be configured depending on your repository details.
